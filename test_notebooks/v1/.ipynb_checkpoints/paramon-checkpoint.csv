1,Mr. Banky,Paramon no longer knows who Paramon's attack is aimed at. Claire rolls to determine who Paramon attacks.
2,Rococo,"Everyone in the battle is now covered in filigree. It looks EXTRAVAGANT, but it's kind of hard to move with all this. -1DL to accuracy for all"
3,Washi,Paramon's attack is now sticky. Gain the trait (lingering?) for this attack.
4,Ukiyo-e,Everyone must spend the next turn contemplating the majesty of Mt. Fuji.
5,Procrastinate,"Past Ann and Annie bully their current selves. Roll a d2, 1 for Ann and 2 for Annie. The winner of the roll has to make up a secondary effect on the spot, math and everything."
6,Pictionary,"You have 30 seconds to draw what you want to have happen. If Claire likes the drawing, it happens."
7,2 of them,"If there are exactly 2 cats visible in the background of the discord call, Paramon may attack twice this turn."
8,Lend a hand,Several of Fenumon's detached limbs from past episodes reappear and hold down the foe. Add +1DL to accuracy.
9,Diary,Paramon is full of secrets and shares one with the target. The target shares a secret back.
10,Illuminate,Paramon is now gold. This has no other effect.

12,Punctuate,(do something with flipping through a Style Guide?)
13,Crumple Zone,The next attack aimed at Paramon is less effective due to Paramon's superior paper engineering and energy management. -1DL to damage
14,Skeet,"For this turn, Paramon can speak, but only through posts by Ann or Annie on social media. Godspeed."
15,Celluloid,"Paramon is composed of nitate film instead of paper, making Paramon catastrophically flammable. Roll a d6. If you are indoors and you roll a 3 or above, the building is now on fire."
16,Kerning,Flip a coin. All participants in the battle are now either 100 yards apart or within 1 yard of one another.
17,Print,"Paramon leaves ink on the target after attacking. If they care about their outfit, this will leave a stain. Also, they lose -1DL to dodge? or whatever it's called now IDK."
18,Derivative,"Paramon uses one other ally digimon's attack this turn, but without their special effects. If Paramon is fighting alone, Paramon has no ideas for a cool atk. Poor baby."
19,Italic,"For this turn, everthing is either in italics or is leaning at a very fancy angle. Everybody's grace is either raised or lowered by 1DL depending on how well they take to the life of a fancy letter"
20,Going Riley Mode,"I have asked a subject matter expert, Riley, to provide input. Bind, Force, Stun, Superficial, Melee. I'm vibing with a mass stun and bind, making the enemy lose two turns and changing their position/throwing them off a cliff. Paramon absolutely breaks the game at one target."

24,Penpal,"Paramon's attack fails, but Paramon can write a little letter to Jordan or Sophie during the turn."

26,Goggles,"Did Christina bring her goggles to this recording? If yes, add 1DL to accuracy to an ally."
27,Query,"Open wikipedia. Ask Christina and Jake for one word each. Read the first sentence of the first wikipedia article those two words together returns. If it doesn't return anything, Paramon's attack gains the drawback ???"
28,Purple Prose (Rhyme Hell Punishment),"Ann and Annie must rhyme, that much is required. Until their downtime, better hope they're inspired."

32,Ex Libris,"Rename the discord call ""PARAMON'S REALLY FLY DISCORD CALL"""
33,Misplace,"Claire chooses a location on the battlefield. Paramon has lost Paramon's tail. If Paramon guesses where the tail is first try, Paramon may attack. If not, Paramon continues to look for Paramon's tail until assuming a new fold at the start of the next turn."
34,Chill,"Ask Ann, Annie, Jake, and Christina the local temperature. If any of them are below freezing, Paramon can freeze the target with Paramon's attack."
35,Treble Jig,"Paramon does a jaunty little number, accompanied by accordion music or a fiddle or something."
36,Redistribution,"Stress cards are split evenly between all digimon in battle. If there aren't enough for the class, they're all discarded."
37,Curiculum Vitae,Paramon may have lied about Paramon's stats a teensy bit to get the job. Paramon's wits and brawn are actually -1DL this turn.
38,I Spy,"One human and one digimon player both write down the name of a nearby digimon who is not Paramon. If they write the same name, Paramon can give that digimon an extra D10 on their next turn."
39,Inventory,"Go around the group and do a can check. If nobody has a beverage, subtract a d4 from the accuracy roll for your next attack"
40,TPS Report,Paramon is composed of extremely long and incredibly boring documents. Paramon grows to giant size and takes the skill???
41,Verboten,"If anyone has said the word ""Pokemon"" during the current recording, Paramon's attack does max damage."
42,Spelling Bee,"*BEFORE YOU READ THIS OUT LOUD, ask Jake or Christina for a good word. If the other can spell that word, add a D4 to the accuracy roll of your attack"
43,Shuffle,"Paramon's fold switches before the attack goes off, as if a new turn started. You cannot change your attack move or target."
44,HIStory repeats,"Rather than rolling for it, Paramon will revert to the HEART Fold next turn."

49,Musicality,Ann and Annie must communicate the next round as Paramon solely through kazoos
50,Keyword,Ann or Annie open a nearby fiction book to a random page and put their finger on a random noun or adjective. Jake and Christina come up with a status effect that fits that word.

52,Papercut,"Paramon's attack gains whatever Digidice ability is closest to ""bleeding"""
53,Birthday Boy,"Everyone gets a paper crown, but any stress dealt to Paramon will result in a condition after the battle. Golly birthdays sure are scary!"
54,Safety First,"Paramon gets a hard hat, hi-vis, and safety glasses. These make Paramon +1D6 easier to hit, but lower the damage Paramon receives by -1D6"
55,Tutorial,"Paramon gains a level after this battle concludes. If Paramon was already going to gain a level, this does not add an additional level."
56,Backup,"If Paramon is digi-dusted this battle, worry not! Paramon reappears, restored from a recent backup. Excellent digital preservation work, everybody!"
57,HERstory repeats,"Rather than rolling for it, Paramon will revert to the WITS Fold next turn."
